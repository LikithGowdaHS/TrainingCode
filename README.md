Programs done during Training


Non-Divisible Subset : 
  Given a set, S, of n distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset,S' , of S where the sum of any 2 numbers in S' are not evenly divisible by k.

Chocolate Feast:
  Little Bobby loves chocolate, and he frequently goes to his favorite 5&10 store, Penny Auntie, with n dollars to buy chocolates. Each chocolate has a flat cost of c dollars, and the store has a promotion where they allow you to trade in m chocolate wrappers in exchange for 1 free piece of chocolate.

  For example, if m=2 and Bobby has n=4 dollars that he uses to buy 4 chocolates at c=1 dollar apiece, he can trade in the 4 wrappers to buy 2 more chocolates. Now he has 2 more wrappers that he can trade in for 1 more chocolate. Because he only has 1 wrapper left at this point and 1<m, he was only able to eat a total of 7 pieces of chocolate.

  Given n, c, and m for t trips to the store, can you determine how many chocolates Bobby eats during each trip?

Missing Numbers:
  Numeros, the Artist, had two lists A and B, such that B was a permutation of A. Numeros was very proud of these lists. Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to another, some numbers were left out of A. Can you find the missing numbers?

Camel Case:
  Alice wrote a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters, S, having the following properties:

  It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
  All letters in the first word are lowercase.
  For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is uppercase and rest of the letters are lowercase.
Given s, print the number of words in s on a new line.

Game of Thrones - I:
  Dothraki are planning an attack to usurp King Roberts throne. King Robert learns of this conspiracy from Raven and plans to lock the single door through which the enemy can enter his kingdom door
  
  But, to lock the door he needs a key that is an anagram of a certain palindrome string.

  The king has a string composed of lowercase English letters. Help him figure out whether any anagram of the string can be a palindrome or not.

Pangrams:
  Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)

  After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.

  Given a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.

Kangaroo:
  There are two kangaroos on an x-axis ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, can you determine if theyll ever land at the same location at the same time?
  
Angry Professor
  A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of N students. Frustrated with their lack of discipline, he decides to cancel class if fewer than K students are present when class starts.
  Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.

Divisible Sum Pairs:
  You are given an array of n integers,a0,a1,a2,......an-1 , and a positive integer, k. Find and print the number of pairs(i,j) where i<j and ai +aj is evenly divisible by k.

Cut The Sticks:
  You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

  Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:
          5 4 4 2 2 8
  Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 
          3 2 2 6
  The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

  Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.
    Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).
